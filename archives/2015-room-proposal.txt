== Devroom Name ==

Open Ruby Language Summit

== Description ==

The Open Ruby Language Summit is a focused developer room around the Ruby
programming language and the open source projects which implement it. While the
Ruby community does have a number of regional conferences devoted to its use,
opportunities for those interested in the "how it works" of Ruby interpreters
and virtual machines are practically non-existent. The goal of this developer
room is to discuss:

* The current state of the Ruby language
* Techniques employed by various VMs and their effectiveness
* Upcoming Ruby language features, and the challenges/benefits that they provide
* Tools and practices used to certify Ruby language conformity and performance
* Costs and Opportunities provided by the multitude of implementations

== Project URLs ==

* JRuby <http://jruby.org>
* Ruby (MRI) <https://www.ruby-lang.org/>
* RubyTruffle <http://www.chrisseaton.com/rubytruffle/>
* Rubinius (Ruby on Ruby) <http://rubini.us/>

== Preferred Day ==

Either day would work great

== Why should FOSDEM accept this proposal ==

While many Ruby developers attend FOSDEM, the Ruby open source community has
generally been underrepresented in the technical content of the event. With the
Open Ruby Language Summit not only would the Ruby community become more plugged
into the FOSDEM experience, but FOSDEM would be hosting Ruby-oriented content
that is both unique and very technical. Considering the broad interest in
dynamic and interpreted languages, the Open Ruby Language Summit would also
provide compelling technical content interesting to members of the Python,
Perl, JavaScript, Smalltalk, LLVM and Java communities. There is quite some
interest in the topic, as the overcrowded Java dev room for Charles Oliver
Nutters talk on JRuby showed.


Considering the number of notable Ruby implementations, listed below, there
should be more than enough highly interesting and technical content!

* Ruby (MRI, the original C-based VM)
* JRuby (Ruby on the JVM)
* Rubinius (Ruby on Ruby)
* Topaz (Ruby on RPython, the toolkit that PyPy built)
* RubyTruffle (JRuby using Oracle's Truffle compiler)
* RubyMotion (Ruby on top of Apple's Objective-C/Cocoa foundation)
* Maglev (Ruby on the GemStone Smalltalk VM)
* Opal (A working Ruby to JavaScript transpiler)

A smaller (60-80 seats) room should be sufficient for a first year dev room.
